            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
            down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
            about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
            back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
            designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you
            come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club
            which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
            you’ll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts.
            During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
            can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
            Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about
            the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

            Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
            to making science accessible to all. Over the course of human
            history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire,
            wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far
            away to the very building blocks of life itself. The aim of our
            museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the
            wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong
            passion to continue the exploration of the world around us. We
            believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
            to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
            exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
            these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
            to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
            only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more
            about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students
            through for a visit.
